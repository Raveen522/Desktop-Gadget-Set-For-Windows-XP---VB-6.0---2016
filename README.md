# Desktop-Gadget-Set-For-Windows-XP---VB-6.0---2016

In my childhood I was used Windows XP computer with low specs (Intel Pentium 4 1.4Ghz CPU, 384MB of RAM, 32MB of VGA, 80GB of HDD). I very loved desktop gadgets was in Windows 7. But because of low spec of my PC, I couldn’t use Windows 7 smoothly. But I wanted to use desktop gadgets in my PC. I tried Google Desktop. 
After few months My passion was changed to learn programming because I wanted to develop an OS. So, I started learning programming in 2015. I choose VB6.0 as my very first programming language. After gaining some knowledge in programming I thought to design and develop my own desktop gadget set. 
In 2016 I have developed a desktop gadget set for Windows XP using VB6.0. On those days, I was readying for my GCE OL. In my free times I did the development of this project. It was very nice and enjoyable developing desktop gadgets because I didn’t know many things that wanted for that. I learned those things while developing. After few months I completed my task. Even today when I see that I’m very happy and very proud of me. Because with a Low spec computer I did great start to my future.
